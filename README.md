```swift
let releaseTAG = "3.0.0"
...
...
...
.binaryTarget(
            name: "Approov",
            url: "https://github.com/approov/approov-ios-sdk/releases/download/" + releaseTAG + "/Approov.xcframework.zip",
            checksum : "5ec60ea00e8e10f34ee3c56033f26d78a8076224e89b6968b74bd1325b688653"
        )
